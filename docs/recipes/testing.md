# Testing

## Unit testing

The recommended workflow is `karma` + `jasmine` + `phantomjs`, you can easily setup this feature by using [vbuild-karma](https://github.com/egoist/vbuild-karma).

## E2E testing

For end-to-end tesing (browser automated testing), you may use [nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/).
